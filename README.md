#Review of Automatic Image Orientation Methods
In [1] Vailaya et al present “an algorithm for automatic image orientation using a Bayesian learning framework”. 
Using Kohonen’s learning vector quantization (LVQ) as well as comparing principal component analysis (PCA) and 
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. Performance was then compared to several well-known 
classifiers. This paper is summarized and its method independently implemented for several datasets. Finally, 
several other citing [1] are consulted. Modest results are achieved using the initially proposed algorithm on 
several unaltered datasets.
